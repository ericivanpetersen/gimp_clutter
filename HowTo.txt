GIMP Plug-in that compiles Cluttersims and PDS Radargram
	in a layered GIMP file for ease of viewing for
	fast or detailed comparison. GIMP allows zooming
	in and altering levels to fit the situation or the
	radar interpreter's preferences.

This Plug-in is designed to work for members of SWIM (Subsurface
	Water Ice Mapping) with access to the "SWIMming Pool."
	However, it can easily be modified for use on another
	machine by altering the filepaths in the python function
	used by the plug-in.

To Use the Plug-in:
	-With GIMP closed, insert the "gimp_clutter_swim.py"
		file in GIMP's plug-ins directory. If you don't
		know where this is you can find out in 
		GIMP > Preferences > Folders > Plug-ins
	-Open GIMP
	-Open Filters > Python-Fu > Console
	-In the Console, type in the following:
		pdb.python_fu_clutter('Orbit_Number', 'Region')
	-'Orbit Number' should be 7 digits long; 6 digit orbits
		should be preceded by a "0"
	-'Region' should have an initial letter capitalized. The
		only options that should work here are:
			Onilus
			Utopia
			Arcadia
			Acidalia
		If any new regions are added and their clutter sim
		and PDS radargram images uploaded in the same file
		path format they should work in this scheme too.
	-A couple examples of command line runs:
		pdb.python_fu_clutter('4592401','Onilus')
		pdb.python_fu_clutter('0169201','Utopia')
	-After running the command you should see an image opened in
		GIMP with a layer for each PDS Radargram or Clutter
		Sim product image.

To Use Batch Plug-in:
	-Insert "gimp_clutter_batch.py" into gimp plug-ins, as described
		above.
	-Run the following command in the Python-Fu console in gimp:
		pdb.python_fu_batch_clutter({clutter_directory}, {pds_tif_directory}, {output_directory})
	-The plug-in will create gimp files for all the clutter simulations/pds tif
		combinations it finds, putting them in the output directory.
	-Error messages and print statements specific to the program are 
		output to {output_dir}/gimpstderr.txt and {output_dir}/gimpstdout.txt
		respectively.
