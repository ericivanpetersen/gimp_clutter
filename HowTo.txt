GIMP Plug-in that compiles Cluttersims and PDS Radargram
	in a layered GIMP file for ease of viewing for
	fast or detailed comparison. GIMP allows zooming
	in and altering levels to fit the situation or the
	radar interpreter's preferences.

This Plug-in was originally designed to work for members of SWIM (Subsurface
	Water Ice Mapping) with access to the "SWIMming Pool."
	The scripts "gimp_clutter_swim," "gimp_clutter_swim2,"
	and ""gimp_clutter_batch" are those designed for the 
	SWIM project.

The "gimp_clutter" script is a generalized version of 
	"gimp_clutter_swim" that can be modified for 
	different file systems and projects.

To Use the Plug-in:
	-Open the "gimp_clutter" script after cloning to one's 
		own machine. Modify the filepaths to direct the 
		script to the locations of cluttersim and PDS
		radargram image files on one's machine. Save.
	-With GIMP closed, insert the "gimp_clutter.py"
		file in GIMP's plug-ins directory. If you don't
		know where this is you can find out in 
		GIMP > Preferences > Folders > Plug-ins
	-Open GIMP
	-Open Filters > Python-Fu > Console
	-In the Console, type in the following:
		pdb.python_fu_clutter('Orbit_Number')
	-'Orbit Number' should be 7 digits long; 6 digit orbits
		should be preceded by a "0"
	-'Region' should have an initial letter capitalized. The
		only options that should work here are:
			Onilus
			Utopia
			Arcadia
			Acidalia
		If any new regions are added and their clutter sim
		and PDS radargram images uploaded in the same file
		path format they should work in this scheme too.
	-A couple examples of command line runs:
		pdb.python_fu_clutter('4592401')
		pdb.python_fu_clutter('0169201')
	-After running the command you should see an image opened in
		GIMP with a layer for each PDS Radargram or Clutter
		Sim product image.

To Use the SWIM Plug-in (SWIM Project Only):
	-With GIMP closed, insert the "gimp_clutter_swim.py"
		file in GIMP's plug-ins directory. If you don't
		know where this is you can find out in 
		GIMP > Preferences > Folders > Plug-ins
	-Open GIMP
	-Open Filters > Python-Fu > Console
	-In the Console, type in the following:
		pdb.python_fu_clutter('Orbit_Number')
	-'Orbit Number' should be 7 digits long; 6 digit orbits
		should be preceded by a "0"
	-'Region' should have an initial letter capitalized. The
		only options that should work here are:
			Onilus
			Utopia
			Arcadia
			Acidalia
		If any new regions are added and their clutter sim
		and PDS radargram images uploaded in the same file
		path format they should work in this scheme too.
	-A couple examples of command line runs:
		pdb.python_fu_clutter('4592401','Onilus')
		pdb.python_fu_clutter('0169201','Utopia')
	-After running the command you should see an image opened in
		GIMP with a layer for each PDS Radargram or Clutter
		Sim product image.

To Use Batch Plug-in (SWIM Project Only): 
	-Insert "gimp_clutter_batch.py" into gimp plug-ins, as described
		above.
	-Run the following command in the Python-Fu console in gimp:
		pdb.python_fu_batch_clutter({clutter_directory}, {pds_tif_directory}, {output_directory})
	-The plug-in will create gimp files for all the clutter simulations/pds tif
		combinations it finds, putting them in the output directory.
	-Error messages and print statements specific to the program are 
		output to {output_dir}/gimpstderr.txt and {output_dir}/gimpstdout.txt
		respectively.
